FINAL VIDEO NOTES

Add shortcodes - no changes in code

(1) foundation shortcodes "Easy Foundation Shortcode" plugin
(2) if you use shortcodes in your content and later change your theme,
the shortcodes won't work anymore

Testing Your WP Theme
(1) Click through everything, forms, links, titles
(2) wp_title() won't display anything on the homepage
(3) add bloginfo( 'name' ) to header.php
(4) add more params to wp_title, like adding a pipe char separator
(5) also, test your site with debug mode on, it's useful during developmnt
(6) open up main WP install >> wp-config.php >> scroll down to WP_DEBUG
(7) turn it on to true, and see what happens
(8) turn it off in production environment

(13) styles for WordPress-generated css
(14) Theme-Check plugin
(15) an easy way to solve the styles problem in our themes is to copy them
from a default theme's style.css
(16) Text domain problems = text domain, what it is doing is, it's saying 
display the following text, but what the error is complaining about, is
it's asking for a second parameter that defines what this text is so that
we can create a language file.
(17) So all we need to do to fix this is go to LN39 single.php, for example,
and pass in a unique param here, say 'treehouse-portfolio', and now it's fixed
(18) But we still have the same issue in page.php, so copy paste it there too,
and it's fixed; same in index.php; functions.php; 
(19) Now it's complaining about not having comments.php
(20) flexible-width and fixed-with no longer apply, we need to use fluid-layout and
fixed-layout; to to style.css theme comment up top and change it in tags
(21) pagination in home.php
(22) post_class(), add it to the element that contains our posts, similar to 
body_class, it'll give us id="post-4564" categories etc. 
(23) so let's come back into our home.php, and find <article class="post">
(24) change it to <article <?php post_class('post'); ?>>, we're passing it the
param of 'post' which will make sure that it adds that, it adds post as a class.
(25) So use theme-check plugin as a learning tool, you may find that you know 
nothing about a particular error
(27) http://generatewp.com/ - very good
